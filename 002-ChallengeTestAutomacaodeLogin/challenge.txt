# Challenge 002: Login Automation and Product Verification

## üéØ Challenge Objective

Develop a Python script using **Selenium** to automate the login process on the "Sauce Demo" demonstration website and verify that the product inventory page is loaded with the expected items.

## üìã Requirements and Step-by-Step

The script must follow this automation logic:

1.  **Navigation and Filling:**
    * Open the browser and navigate to the login page.
    * Locate the username and password fields and fill them with the provided credentials.
    * Click the login button.

2.  **Destination Page Validation:**
    * After logging in, verify that the browser's URL corresponds to the inventory page (`/inventory.html`).
    * Validate that a key element of the page, such as the "Products" title, is visible, confirming the page loaded correctly.

3.  **Content Verification:**
    * Extract the names of all products listed on the page.
    * Check if a specific product (e.g., "Sauce Labs Backpack") is present in the extracted list of names.

4.  **Final Report:**
    * The script should print a clear message to the console indicating the success or failure of the test.
