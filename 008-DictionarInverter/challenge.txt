## üá¨üáß Challenge: The Dictionary Inverter

### Scenario

You are working with a dataset that maps user IDs to their usernames. For a specific task, you need to create a reverse lookup: find a user's ID based on their username. Your mission is to create a function that "inverts" this mapping.

### Your Mission

Write a function that takes a dictionary (in Python) or an object (in JavaScript) and returns a new one where the keys become values and the values become keys.

### Requirements

1.  The function must accept a dictionary/object as an argument.
2.  It must return a new dictionary/object with the keys and values swapped.
3.  **The Crucial Rule:** If there are duplicate values in the original dictionary (which would result in duplicate keys in the new one), the function must group the original keys into a **list/array**.

### Examples

* **Input:** `{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}`
    * **Expected Output:** `{1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}`

* **Input:** `{'Ana': 25, 'Bruno': 30, 'Carla': 25}`
    * **Expected Output:** `{25: ['Ana', 'Carla'], 30: 'Bruno'}` (Note that 'Ana' and 'Carla' were grouped into a list under the key 25)

* **Input:** `{'Apple': 'Fruit', 'Banana': 'Fruit', 'Carrot': 'Vegetable'}`
    * **Expected Output:** `{'Fruit': ['Apple', 'Banana'], 'Vegetable': 'Carrot'}`


### ‚≠ê Bonus Point

Can you solve this concisely using a Dictionary Comprehension in Python or functional methods like `.reduce()` in JavaScript?
