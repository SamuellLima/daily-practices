# Challenge 009: Two Sum Problem

## ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Challenge: Two Sum

### Scenario

You are working on a financial system and need to find two transactions in a list that, when added together, result in a specific target value. Doing this efficiently is crucial for system performance. This is a classic algorithm problem frequently asked in technical interviews.

### Your Mission

Write a function that takes an array of integers and a target number. The function should find two **different** numbers in the array that add up exactly to the target value. The return value should be the **indices** (positions) of these two numbers.

### Requirements

1.  The function must accept an array of numbers and a target number as arguments.
2.  It should return an array or tuple containing the **indices** of the two numbers that sum up to the target.
3.  You can assume that each input will have exactly one solution.
4.  You may not use the same element twice.

### Examples

| Input | Target | Expected Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `[2, 7, 11, 15]` | `9` | `[0, 1]` |
| `[3, 2, 4]` | `6` | `[1, 2]` |
| `[3, 3]` | `6` | `[0, 1]` |
