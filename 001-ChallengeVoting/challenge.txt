Challenge: The Poll Winner üó≥Ô∏è
The Scenario:
You have been hired to quickly tally the votes from an online poll about people's favorite programming language. You received the votes in a list, but it's completely disorganized.

Your Mission:
Write a Python function called `tally_votes` that receives a list of strings (the votes) and returns the name of the winner.

Requirements:

The function must receive a list as an argument. Ex: ['Python', 'JavaScript', 'Python', 'C++', 'Python', 'JavaScript'].

It must count the votes for each "candidate" (each language).

The winner is the candidate with the highest number of votes.

The Crucial Rule: If there is a tie for first place, the function must return the string "TIE".

The function must return only one string: the name of the winner or "TIE".

Examples to Test:

Input: votes1 = ['Python', 'JavaScript', 'Python', 'C++', 'Python', 'JavaScript']

Expected Output: 'Python' (Python: 3 votes, JavaScript: 2, C++: 1)

Input: votes2 = ['Cat', 'Dog', 'Dog', 'Cat', 'Fish']

Expected Output: 'TIE' (Cat: 2 votes, Dog: 2 votes)

Input: votes3 = ['Zul', 'Xuxa', 'Zul', 'Zul', 'Xuxa']

Expected Output: 'Zul' (Zul: 3 votes, Xuxa: 2 votes)
