# My Daily Practices

This repository serves as a public journal of studies and practices in various types of languages, with a primary focus on Python and JS. Here, I document my learning journey, as well as my progress by solving one or two programming challenges per day, allowing me to track my own evolution.

## 🐱‍💻 About the Project

As a developer who uses programming as a means to survive, I recognize the importance of keeping the fundamentals sharp. Therefore, I dedicate daily time here to **deliberate practice**, aiming to solve one challenge per day, focusing on small problems that stimulate logical reasoning and deepen my knowledge in each language I set out to learn.

The main goal is not perfection, but **consistency** and **progress**.

## ✝ Motivation

* **To visibly track my progress** (the infamous and coveted "green wall" of GitHub!).
* **To build the habit** of consistent practice—a little each day, as practice makes perfect.
* **To create a living portfolio** that demonstrates my personal and unique evolution as a developer, even with small challenges.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The structure consists simply of an enumeration of each challenge in its own numbered folder, with each folder containing the proposed challenge and its solution.

For example:

/001-VotingChallenge
│
├── challenge.txt    (The statement of the proposed challenge)
│
├── solution.py      (The code with the solution I found)
