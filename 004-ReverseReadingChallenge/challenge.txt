# Challenge 004: The Selective Word Inverter

## 🎯 The Challenge

**Challenge proposed directly by Miguel Dias**

The objective is to create a function that applies a "reverse reading rule" to a sentence, inverting only the words considered "long," while keeping the overall structure of the sentence completely intact.

## 📜 The Scenario

You are working on a system that needs to apply a special formatting rule to texts to create a stylistic effect or a simple form of encoding. The rule is as follows: every word with 5 or more letters must be written backward. Shorter words, as well as punctuation and spaces, must be kept in their original positions.

## 📋 Requirements

1.  Create a function that receives a `string` (a sentence) as an argument.
2.  The function must iterate through the sentence and identify each word.
3.  If a word has **5 or more letters**, it must be inverted.
4.  If a word has **fewer than 5 letters**, it must remain unchanged.
5.  All punctuation (`,`, `.`, `!`, `?`, etc.) and spaces must be preserved in their original positions.

## ✅ Examples to Test

| Input | Expected Output |
| :--- | :--- |
| `"Este é um desafio de programação"` | `"Este é um oifased de oãçamargorp"` |
| `"Olá mundo, como vai você?"` | `"Olá odnum, como vai êcov?"` |
| `"Isto é fácil!"` | `"Isto é licáf!"` |
| `"Python é legal"` | `"nohtyP é lagel"` |


## ⭐ Bonus Point

Make the function correctly handle words that contain hyphens (e.g., "guarda-chuva" should be treated as a single word and inverted as "avuhc-adraug").

  * To split the sentence into words, the string method `.split()` can be a good starting point.
