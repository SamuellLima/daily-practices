Success is a sum of small efforts - repeated day after day. Python, one of the most popular programming languages, makes working with text much easier.
In this challenge, the objective is to count words. Counting words may seem simple, but counting well requires attention.
Attention to details, such as removing ratings and stopwords.
We repeat: daily effort leads to success. Success, success, success!
