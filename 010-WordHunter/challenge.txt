CHALLENGE #10: WORD HUNTER
=======================================

OBJECTIVE:
To create a Python script that analyzes a text file to find and list the most used words, ignoring punctuation and common filler words (stopwords) to obtain a more meaningful result.

---------------------------------------
THE CHALLENGE:
---------------------------------------

The script must be able to perform the following tasks, in order:

1. READ THE FILE: Open and read the entire content of a text file named `input.txt`.

2. STANDARDIZE THE TEXT: Convert all text to lowercase so that words like "Success" and "success" are counted as the same.

3. CLEAN THE TEXT: Remove all punctuation characters (commas, periods, hyphens, etc.), keeping only letters and spaces.

4. TOKENIZE: Break the clean text into a list of individual words.

5. FILTER STOPWORDS: Remove from the list all words considered "stopwords" (articles, prepositions, conjunctions like "the", "a", "of", "for", etc.), using the NLTK library to get a standard list for the chosen language.

6. COUNT THE FREQUENCY: Calculate how many times each remaining word appears in the filtered list.

7. PRESENT THE RESULT: Clearly display the top 10 most common words found, along with their counts, in descending order from most frequent to least frequent.

---------------------------------------
SKILLS PRACTICED:
---------------------------------------

* File Handling (reading .txt files).
* String Manipulation and Regular Expressions (Regex) for data cleaning.
* Data Structures: Dictionaries (for counting, via `collections.Counter`) and Sets (for the stopword list, ensuring performance).
* List Comprehensions for efficient data filtering.
* Using External Libraries (NLTK for stopwords).
* Clean and Modular Code Organization.

HOW TO RUN:
---------------------------------------

--- PREPARATION (only needs to be done once) ---

1. Install dependencies:
   In your terminal, inside this challenge's folder, run the command:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Download NLTK data:
   Run a Python terminal (by typing `python` or `py` in your main terminal) and execute the following commands:
   import nltk
   nltk.download('stopwords')

--- EXECUTION ---

After preparation, to run the challenge, simply add the path of your .txt to the variable and run the main script:
python solution.py
